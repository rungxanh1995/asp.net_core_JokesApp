# The Jokes App
## About
This is an ASP.NET Core web app for jokes with CRUD operations.
It's a code-along project following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfEjDD8mWYg&t=28s) by [Shad Sluiter](https://www.youtube.com/user/shadsluiter).

## Get Started
1. Download the source code on `master` branch.
2. Open using `Microsoft Visual Studio`, `JetBrains Rider`, or any other C# IDEs
3. (OPTIONAL) If you're using `JetBrains Rider`, connect to the project database via file `./app.db`
4. Build and run the app.

## Trivia

I coded this project on an M1 Mac using `JetBrains Rider` IDE, so I had to do some research for alternatives to some actions in the [tutorial above](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfEjDD8mWYg&t=28s), which was completely Windows-dependent and Visual Studio-dependent.

Therefore, feel free to contact me (if needed) and I'll be willing to help you with anything to getting this project up and going on your Mac environment. 



From one Apple user/developer to another, cheers! ðŸ¥³
